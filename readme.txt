This C# simulation program models an emergency response system where users can interact with different types of emergency units (Police, Firefighters, and Ambulances). The system is designed to handle various types of incidents like "Crime", "Fire", and "Medical" by dispatching the most appropriate unit based on the incident type. The program starts with a list of available emergency units, each with a specific response speed. Users can choose the type of incident and its location, and the system will select the best available unit to handle the emergency, prioritizing speed and unit capabilities.

Once the incident is selected by the user, the program identifies the most suitable unit for the job. For example, if a "Crime" incident occurs, only the police units are eligible to respond. The program will choose the police unit with the fastest response time. Each unit has a unique response sequence to simulate its actions when arriving at the scene, such as investigating, resolving, and clearing the situation. Once a unit responds to an incident, it is removed from the list of available units for that round, and the user earns points for successfully handling the emergency.

The simulation runs for a set number of rounds, and the userâ€™s score accumulates based on how efficiently the emergencies are handled. After each round, the user is prompted to enter the next incident's details, and the simulation continues until all rounds are completed. At the end of the simulation, the total score is displayed, giving the user a sense of their performance in managing emergency responses. This program is ideal for testing the user's decision-making abilities in high-pressure situations, ensuring fast and accurate resource allocation.
